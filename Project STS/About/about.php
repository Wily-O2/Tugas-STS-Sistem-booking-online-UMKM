                Wily is the one who makes Toura actually look and feel <br>
                like the slick platform people rave about. <br>
                When a design suddenly transforms into a pixel-perfect, <br>
                responsive page that works across every browser (even <br>
                the old ones you forgot existed), that’s Wily quietly <br>
                working late. <br>
                He translates endless design tweaks into real code —<br>
                often before the coffee even kicks in.

            <div class="Text-L-W">
                Lewis is the magician behind the curtain, making sure all <br>
                the serious stuff—bookings, payments, data—never <br>
                crash and burn. <br>
                He’s fluent in server spells and database incantations, <br>
                though you’ll mostly hear him say things like “It works on <br>
                my machine” with a suspicious grin. <br>
                If the front end is shiny, it’s because Lewis built the <br>
                fortress underneath so nothing collapses when <br>
                thousands of users pile in.

                Valentino has an eye for beauty and a talent for “just one more tweak. <br>
                ”He’ll spend an entire afternoon debating a single shade of gray, <br>
                but somehow the result does end up looking fantastic. <br>
                Every time you hover over a button and it feels strangely satisfying, <br>
                that’s his handiwork—after he’s finally decided that, yes, <br>
                this version is “the one”… until tomorrow.
